 ## How to run

 First on the root create a file called `variables.env`

 Inside this create two variables one called `DB_MONGO` with the acces to your mongodb database and a second one called `SECRETA` with any word to encrypt the tokens

 Now, install the node dependencies 

 ```bash
    npm install
 ```

 Now run the server locally

 ```bash
    npm run dev
 ```

 Now you can see the graphql playground on [https://localhost:4000](https://localhost:4000)

 This server is complemented with a web app and you can acces to the repositorie [here](https://github.com/ThomyR73/CRMGraphQLClient)
